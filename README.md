## Welcome to my humble (for now) profile

I am an aspiring developer with no current fixed direction.
I wish I could lock myself away and just... code. 

### Current Activites
- Iâ€™m currently learning Software Engineering Practices at CSE 110, UCSD.
- On the side, I desire to learn Operating Systems development, referencing [Operating Systems: From 0 to 1](https://github.com/tuhdo/os01)

### Other TODOS:
- I plan to finish my older projects, and to refactor my rough code using SWE Design Patterns and (yet to be learned) C OOD.
- I also plan to fix my repositories and add READMEs/tests for each project. 

### Old, to be continued projects
- [txteditor](https://github.com/MerlinHelp/txteditor): An unfinished terminal-based text-editor in C from the [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) tutorial.
- [dynmem](https://github.com/MerlinHelp/dynmem): Remodeling dynamically alloc'ed mem (basic alloc) from 32-bit to 64-bit code from the [A Malloc Tutorial](https://wiki-prog.infoprepa.epita.fr/images/0/04/Malloc_tutorial.pdf) tutorial
