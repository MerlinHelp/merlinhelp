## Welcome to my humble profile

I am an aspiring developer with no current fixed direction.
All I want is to disappear and just... code. 

### Current Activites
- Iâ€™m currently learning Operating Systems in CSE 120, UCSD.
- On the side, I desire to learn Operating Systems development, referencing [Operating Systems: From 0 to 1](https://github.com/tuhdo/os01)

### Other TODOS:
- I plan to finish my older projects, and to refactor old code
- I also plan to fix my repositories and add READMEs/tests for each project. 

### To be continued projects
- [txteditor](https://github.com/MerlinHelp/txteditor): An unfinished terminal-based text-editor in C from the [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) tutorial.
